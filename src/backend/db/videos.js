      "The film finds Thor (Chris Hemsworth) on a journey unlike anything he`s ever faced, a quest for inner peace. But his retirement is interrupted by a galactic killer known as Gorr the God Butcher (Christian Bale), who seeks the extinction of the gods. To combat the threat, Thor enlists the help of King Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), Korg (Taika Waititi) and ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), who - to Thor`s surprise  inexplicably wields his magical hammer, Mjolnir, as the Mighty Thor. Together, they embark upon a harrowing cosmic adventure to uncover the mystery of the God Butcher`s vengeance and stop him before its too late. Directed by Waititi (‚ÄúThor: Ragnarok,‚Äù ‚ÄúJojo Rabbit‚Äù) and produced by Kevin Feige and Brad Winderbaum, ‚ÄúThor: Love and Thunder‚Äù opens in theaters July 8, 2022",
